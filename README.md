# pizza-sales-data-analysis

Problem statement: Analyze the pizza sales data to extract actionable business insights by identifying and evaluating relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Approach:

1) The raw data was first cleaned and processed using Microsoft Excel to retain only the information pertinent to the project. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were subsequently identified, including Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, and Total Orders, among others.
2) The processed data was then imported into a MySQL database, enabling efficient retrieval of the information required for KPI calculations. Following this, the cleaned Excel dataset was imported into Power BI Desktop to develop a dynamic and interactive dashboard.
3) The dashboard incorporated visualizations that tracked trends in total orders on both daily and monthly basis. Additionally, it highlighted the top and bottom five performing pizzas, analyzed by revenue, quantity sold, and order count.

Tools: MS-Excel, MySQL, Power BI Desktop

This project provided comprehensive exposure to the end-to-end data analysis process, encompassing data cleaning, processing, visualization, and effective communication of insights.
